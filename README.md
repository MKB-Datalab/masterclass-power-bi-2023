# Masterclass - Introduction to Power BI

<br/><br/>
This repository is part of the MKB Datalab  `Data Readiness Program`.  It contains support material used during the Power BI session offered to students participating in this program.

During these hands-on session students learn some concepts of Power BI, one of the most popular business intelligence platforms. We will explore topics such as:
* Power BI Features
* Power BI Interface
* How to load data into Power BI
* How to transform data (Power Query Editor)
* Introduce DAX (New measure, Quick Measure, â€¦)
* Build visualizations (types, hierarchies, drill-down paths, sorting, filtering, controlling interactivity)
After completing this workshop, you will be able to further explore and use Power BI o build impactful reports and dashboards!

Furthermore, during this session we present some real datasets and some challenges that might be encountered when working with real data.

# Data

For the hands-on part we work with a subset of the 
[Adventure Works Data Warehouse 2019]( https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksDW2019.bak).
