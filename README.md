# Program Data Readiness - Workshop Introduction to Power BI

<br/><br/>
This repository is part of the MKB Datalab  `Data Readiness Program`.  It contains support material used during the Power BI session offered to 
students participating in this program.

During these hands-on session students learn some concepts of Power BI while building a simple dashboard. This comes to use during the program as 
basis to get a standardized Dashboard for each participating SME.

Furthermore, during this session we present some real datasets and some challenges that might be encountered when working with real data.

# Data

For the hands-on part we work with a subset of the 
[Adventure Works Data Warehouse 2019]( https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksDW2019.bak).

The Adventure Works company represents a bicycle manufacturer that sells bicycles and accessories to global markets. The company has their data warehouse data 
stored in an Azure SQL Database.
